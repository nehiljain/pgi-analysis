Gene Meta Analysis
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. This is to document all the analysis done and the explaination of the attributes of ach data table created.

Input:

###Snps found in features. 

File Name : "SNPS_IN_FEATURES.csv"

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
snpsInFeatures <- read.csv("~/coderepo/pgi-ngs-analysis/data/final/SNPS_IN_FEATURES.csv", nrows=1 stringsAsFactors = F, row.names=NULL, header = T)

snpsInFeatures$gene_name <- as.factor(snpsInFeatures$gene_name)
snpsInFeatures$gene_id <- as.factor(snpsInFeatures$gene_id)
snpsInFeatures <- snpsInFeatures[ , -which(names(snpsInFeatures) %in% c("attributes"))]

head(snpsInFeatures)

```

The number of gene names and gene ids in this file are 

```{r}

str(snpsInFeatures$gene_id)
str(snpsInFeatures$gene_name)

```


In trying to identify the duplication of genes, I found example Gene: Nav1 ENSMUSG00000090399 and Gene: Nav1 - ENSMUSG00000009418. So fundamentally I will chose 'gene id' as unique not 'gene name'



###Window Analysis.

File Name: Window_Analysis_Chr1.csv

The file contains a row corresponding to a window in the genes in chr1. The rows in each gene are sorted (in descending order) based on max_snp_cmh_neg_log and mean_snp_cmh_neg_log. So if there are two rows with same max cmh value then the row with the higher mean cmh value is preffered. 

The Features are

- snp_count = number of snps in that window
- max_snp_cmh_neg_log = the max value of the P-Values 
- min_snp_cmh_neg_log = 
- mean_snp_cmh_neg_log = 
- sd_snp_cmh_neg_log = 
- median_snp_cmh_neg_log = 
- gene_id = 
- gene_name = 
- window_index = 







Processing:

- String processing is done to remove gene_name and gene_id from the gene_id and gene_name columns in snpsInFeatures data. Trimming is performed.
